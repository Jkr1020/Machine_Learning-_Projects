# Machine Learning Classification Models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models for classification tasks. The dataset is preprocessed, trained, and tested using **pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib**.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Datasets/** - Contains raw and processed data files
- **Notebooks/** - Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step implementation
- **Scripts/** - Python scripts for model training & evaluation
- **Models/** - Saved trained models
- **Results/** - Visualizations and performance metrics

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing
- Scikit-learn for model training
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for implementation

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jkr1020/Machine_Learning-_Projects.git
   cd Machine_Learning-_Projects
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
